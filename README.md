# School District Analysis

## Overview of the project:

This project analyzes various data regarding the different schools in a school district. The analysis of the school district data comprises of:

1. A summary of the disctrict data.
2. Summary of the statistics of different schools in the district.
3. Math and Reading scores by grades from 9th to 12th.
4. Summary of student performance based on school budget and spending.
5. Summary of student performance based on the size of the school.
6. Summary of student performance based on the type of school.

There are reports that the performance scores for 9th graders at Thomas High School has been altered. This project analyses the data of the district with and without the scores of these 9th graders and makes comparison.

### Purpose:

The analysis of the school district data will enable the board to make better decisions about where to allocate their budget and whether they would need to make any adjustments to their plans for the schools in this district moving forward.

## Results:

1. The removal of Thomas High School 9th grade student data from the analysis did have a small effect on the district data summary. Here is the district summary before Thomas High School's 9th grade data was removed:

We can compare the differences by looking at the district summary after the changes as below:

![New_district_summary](https://github.com/Zarif601/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/New_district_summary.png)

Here we can see that except for the 'Average Reading Score,' every other performance value was affected.

2. Looking at the school summary data from before the removal of 9th grade data from Thomas High School and after, we can see some minor differences across all performance scores. Here is the school summary from before:

![Previous_school_summary](https://github.com/Zarif601/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Previous_school_summary.png)

To compare, here is the school summary after the removal of 9th grade data from Thomas High School:

![New_school_summary](https://github.com/Zarif601/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/New_school_summary.png)

There is only a slight change in the performace values in the new school summary, and only that of Thomas High School. The rest of the data remains unchanged.

3. From the above images we can see that all the performance metrics of Thomas High Schools were affected because of the removal of 9th grade data. This is as expected. However, the changes are not very significant and none of the scores vary by even 1 unit of difference from the previous ones. Also, we can see that the rest of the performance scores from all the other schools remain the same.

4. The math and reading scores by grade data provides a clear idea of how each grade in all the different schools are performing. Here is the math and reading scores by grade data from before 9th grade data from Thomas High School was removed:

![Old_math_scores_by_grade](https://github.com/Zarif601/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Old_math_scores_by_grade.png)

![Old_reading_scores_by_grade](https://github.com/Zarif601/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/Old_reading_scores_by_grade.png)

By comparing with the new data, we can see that only the 9th grade data from Thomas High School has been removed. The rest of the data is unchanged as follows:

![New_math_scores_by_grade](https://github.com/Zarif601/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/New_math_scores_by_grade.png)

![New_reading_scores_by_grade](https://github.com/Zarif601/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/New_reading_scores_by_grade.png)

5. Performance scores by school spending didn't change as a whole. The average math and reading scores and the percentages of students who passed remained the same even after removing 9th grade data of Thomas High School. The scores as shown below:

![Scores_by_school_spending](https://github.com/Zarif601/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/New_scores_by_school_spending.png)

6. Similar to performance scores by school spending, scores grouped by school size were also unchanged from before the removal of data. The removal wasn't significant enough to make a difference in these scores, as shown below:

![Scores_by_size](https://github.com/Zarif601/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/New_scores_by_school_size.png)

7. Scores of student performance based on school type didn't change as well. It remained the same after removal of 9th grade data from Thomas High School. Here are the scores:

![Scores_by_type](https://github.com/Zarif601/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Resources/New_scores_by_school_type.png)

This shows that the overall impact of removing 9th grade data from Thomas High School was very minor for the overall analysis.

## Summary

The removal of 9th grade student data from Thomas High School impacted four sections of analyses in this project. They are listed below:

1. The overall district averages all across the board were impacted marginally.
2. The school summary was unaffected except for the sumary statistics for Thomas High School. Even then the differences were minor.
3. Math scores by grade was unaffected for all other schools except Thomas High School, since their 9th grade data was removed.
4. Similarly, reading scores by grade was also unaffected for all the schools except Thomas High School.
